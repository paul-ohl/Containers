# Containers

42 school project.

Recreation of 3 C++ containers:

## Stack

A very simple container, you can only push and pop data on the stack.

## Vector

A much harder one, it's an array that can dynamically change its size.

## Map

The hardest one, it's an array where you can use any type you want as the key to
retrieve a value.

The underlying data structure is a self-balancing binary tree. I chose the
red-black tree algorithm.

## How to use

First, install the C++ testing library using `./tester_installer`.

Then compile the project using `make`.

Finally, launch the tests using `./ft_containers`.
